        <h4> To reduce your energy costs join sustainable alternatives.</h4>
        <p>Solar panels generate electricity using the radiation emitted by the sun. When such solar panels are fitted onto the top of a building, they are known as rooftop photovoltaic system power stations. Solar energy provides a good return on investment through the use of un-utilized rooftop space and requires minimal maintenance. All of this has a positive impact on your savings and  even greater impact on the environment.</p>
        <p>We provide Rooftop in both ways Off-Grid and On-Grid. <br>
        			On-Grid system in which the rooftop solar system is integrated with the main grid supply. This system allows power to be used from the grid supply only when the rooftop solar system is unable to supply the required power. Thus, a well-planned rooftop system can efficiently supply power without using grid supply saving expenses otherwise incurred on using power from the grid. <br>
           			Off-Grid system in which the rooftop solar system is not linked to the main grid. This system can run on its own with its own battery. The solar power generated from the rooftop solar system charges the battery which is then used to power various applications.
